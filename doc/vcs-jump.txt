INTRO                                                           *vcs-jump-intro*

This plug-in allows you to jump to useful places within a Git or Mercurial
repository: diff hunks, merge conflicts, and "grep" results.

The actual work is done by the included `vcs-jump` script, which is a Ruby
port of the "git-jump" (shell) script from official Git repo, adapted to
work transparently with either Git or Mercurial:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/contrib/git-jump

REQUIREMENTS                                             *vcs-jump-requirements*

- A Ruby interpreter must be available on the host system: the `vcs-jump`
  script uses a "shebang" line of "/usr/bin/env ruby".

INSTALLATION                                             *vcs-jump-installation*

To install vcs-jump, use your plug-in management system of choice.

vcs-jump consists of a Vim plug-in that provides a |:VcsJump| command which
invokes a bundled `vcs-jump` executable. The executable itself is useful
outside of Vim, so you may wish to add the plug-in's `bin` directory to your
`$PATH`; for example, if you installed the plug-in inside
`~/.vim/pack/bundle/vcs-jump`, you could add the following to your shell's
startup file:
>
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.vim/pack/bundle/vcs-jump/bin
<
See |vcs-jump-usage| for a description of usage from the command-line.

USAGE                                                           *vcs-jump-usage*

vcs-jump can be used from inside or outside of Vim. Inside Vim, run |:VcsJump|
to populate the |quickfix| list with "interesting" locations (diff hunks,
merge conflicts, or grep results).

Outside of Vim, provided you have set up your `$PATH` as described in
|vcs-jump-installation|, you can run the bundled `vcs-jump` executable in any of
the following ways to open Vim and immediately populate the |quickfix| list:
>
    vcs-jump diff # find hunks with diffs relative to current HEAD
    vcs-jump diff HEAD~10 # find hunks with diffs relative to specified commit
    vcs-jump grep stuff # find grep results for "stuff"
    vcs-jump merge # find merge conflicts
<
COMMANDS                                                     *vcs-jump-commands*

                                                                      *:VcsJump*
:VcsJump  ~

This command invokes the bundled `vcs-jump` script to get the list of
"interesting" locations (diff hunks, merge conflicts, or grep results) in
the repo, and put them in the |quickfix| list.

Filename completion is available in the context of this command.

Subcommands are:

- "diff": Results are diff hunks. Arguments are passed on to the Mercurial
  or Git `diff` invocation. This means that in the absence of any arguments, a
  diff against the current "HEAD" will be performed, but you can change that
  by passing options (eg. `--cached`) or specifying a target revision to
  compare against.
- "merge": Results are merge conflicts. Arguments are ignored.
- "grep": Results are grep hits. Arguments are given to the underlying Git
  or Mercurial `grep` command.

When called with a trailing |:command-bang| (eg. `:VcsJump!`) the current value
of the |g:VcsJumpMode| setting is inverted for the duration of that invocation.

MAPPINGS                                                     *vcs-jump-mappings*


                                                               *<Plug>(VcsJump)*
This mapping invokes the bundled `vcs-jump` script, defaulting to "diff" mode.

By default, `<Leader>d` will invoke this mapping unless:

- A mapping with the same |{lhs}| already exists; or:
- An alternative mapping to |<Plug>(VcsJump)| has already been defined in your
  |.vimrc|.

You can create a different mapping like this:
>
    " Use <Leader>g instead of <Leader>d
    nmap <Leader>g <Plug>(VcsJump)
<
OPTIONS                                                       *vcs-jump-options*


                                                                 *g:VcsJumpMode*
|g:VcsJumpMode|                                          string (default: "cwd")

Controls whether vcs-jump should operate relative to Vim's current working
directory (when |g:VcsJumpMode| is "cwd", the default) or to the current
buffer (when |g:VcsJumpMode| is "buffer").

To override the default, add this to your |.vimrc|:
>
    let g:VcsJumpMode="buffer"
<
Note that you can temporarily invert the sense of this setting by running
|:VcsJump| with a trailing |:command-bang| (eg. `:VcsJump!`).


                                                               *g:VcsJumpLoaded*
|g:VcsJumpLoaded|                                            any (default: none)

To prevent vcs-jump from being loaded, set |g:VcsJumpLoaded| to any value in
your " |.vimrc|. For example:
>
    let g:VcsJumpLoaded=1
<

HISTORY                                                       *vcs-jump-history*

1.0 (12 October 2019) ~

- Provide a meaningful title for the |quickfix| listing.
- Run `git diff` with `--no-color` to prevent a `git config color.ui` setting of
  "always" from breaking diff mode
  (https://github.com/wincent/vcs-jump/issues/1)
- Add |g:VcsJumpMode| and teach |:VcsJump| to accept a |:command-bang| suffix that
  can be used to make vcs-jump operate relative to the current buffer
  instead of the current working directory (patch from Pascal Lalancette,
  https://github.com/wincent/vcs-jump/pull/5).

0.1 (2 June 2019) ~

- Initial release: originally extracted from my dotfiles in
  https://wincent.com/n/vcs-jump-origin and then iterated on before
  extracting into a standalone Vim plug-in.
